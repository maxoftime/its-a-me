            I had the pleasure of working with Max in my role as Technical Director at Familjen. What makes Max stand out is the pragmatic and technology agnostic attitude. He masters the tech and is a quick learner, but it's the caring and easy-going attitude towards his peers and clients that really makes him stand out. Max is a wonderful team player who you want to be around.
