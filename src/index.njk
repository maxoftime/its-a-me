    <h1>Hello there</h1>
    <p>
        General Kenob.. No sorry, no jedi here. My name is Max. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I am a pragmatic, no-bullshit developer that helps companies and organisations build better products and services. I am currently employed at <a href="https://xlent.se">XLENT</a> as a consultant. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I flourish in the borderlands between design and development. And I love to experiment with new emerging tech to make people say <span clasS="wow">»ooh wow!«</span>.
    </p>

    <h2>So what do I actually do?</h2>
    <p>
       I enhance digital communication by building useful and impactful experiences, I form solid strategies with the data to back them up and I help companies drive innovation with proven methodologies. 
    </p>

    <h2>And that means?</h2>
    <p>
        Mainly that I design andcode websites. But it also means that I help descision making regarding technical strategies. And that I run innovation processes to keep companies performing at their best.
