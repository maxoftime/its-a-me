        I was responsible for developing a new tool under Sunt&nbsp;Arbetslivs multisite umbrella in Wordpress.

    It started by adapting an existing site they had and migrated it to a new domain. Implementation of a new design followed, along with new features and new components for the block builder WP&nbsp;Bakery.
