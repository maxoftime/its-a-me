    <h1>Hello there</h1>
    <p>
        General Kenob.. No sorry, no jedi here. Just Max.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am a pragmatic, no-bullshit developer that helps companies and organisations build better products and services. I am currently employed at <a href="https://www.newport.se">Newport Collection</a> as a frontend developer.
    </p>
    <p>
        I flourish in the borderlands between design and development. And I love to experiment with new emerging tech to make people go <span clasS="wow">»ooh wow!«</span>.
    </p>

    <h2>So what do I actually do?</h2>
    <p>
       I enhance digital communication by building useful and impactful experiences, I form solid strategies with data to back them up and I help companies drive innovation with proven methodologies.
    </p>

    <h2>And that means?</h2>
    <p>
        Mainly that I design and code websites. But it also means that I help decision making regarding technical strategies and implementations.
    </p>
