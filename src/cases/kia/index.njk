<!-- Full Case -->
    <p>
        My role at Kia was to add new pages and also maintain existing pages in their CMS (Adobe Experience Manager CMS). It involved a need for smartness and working around larger issues that was was inherent in the CMS. It also involved developing standalone campaign sites in HTML, CSS and JS. I had close contact with their tech lead and also functioned as an advisory in strategy in the work on their site.
